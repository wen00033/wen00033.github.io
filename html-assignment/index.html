            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Chi-Hung wen from Taiwan, I'm studying Interactive media design at Algonquin College.
                 It is a different career field compared to my previous experience. However, I am interested in 
                 the media sphere. My dream job is to work as a web designer. I'm very interested in traveling, 
                 drawing, and movies. I hope that after I graduate I could make a website about movies and traveling.
            </p>
            <p>This is the second time I come to Canada. I had been to Montreal once about 5 years ago However, this
                 is my first time meeting Canadian winter. I got to say, the temperature here is unforgettable.The
                 first day landed in Canada like <strong>-21<sup>o</sup>C</strong>In my country,the coldest weath 
                 never goes under <strong>10<sup>o</sup>C</strong>.Hopefully, I can get used to the weather as soon as
                 possible.
