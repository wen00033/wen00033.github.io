            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Chi-Hung wen from Taiwan, I'm studying Interactive media design at Algonquin College. It is a different career field compared to my previous experience. However, I am interested in the media sphere. My dream job is to work as a web designer. I'm very interested in traveling, drawing, and movies. I hope that after I graduate I could make a website about movies and traveling.

I got to say, the temperature here is unforgettable.The first day landed in Canada like <strong>-21<sup>o</sup>C</strong>In my country,the coldest weath never goes under <strong>10<sup>o</sup>C</strong>.Hopefully, I can get used to the weather as soon as possible.  </p>
